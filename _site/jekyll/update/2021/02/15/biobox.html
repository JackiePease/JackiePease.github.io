      <h1>Biomaterials - Some Notes from the STEAMhouse Biobox course</h1>
      <article>
        <p>I recently took part in <a href="https://steamhouse.org.uk/events/biobox-workshop/">STEAMhouse’s Biobox Workshop</a> - along with <a href="https://cheapjack.github.io/">Ross Dalziel</a>, a fellow member of <a href="https://doesliverpool.com/">DoES Liverpool</a>’s <a href="https://doesliverpool.github.io/Wearables/">Wearable Tech Group</a>. This was a 4 week course on Thursday mornings which aimed to combine “self-led materials research with live sessions where we will explore different areas related to materials development” and was led by Sarah King of STEAMhouse and Zoe Powell of Materiom. Also attending was <a href="https://cheapjack.github.io/">Ross Dalziel</a>, a fellow member of <a href="https://doesliverpool.com/">DoES Liverpool</a>’s <a href="https://doesliverpool.github.io/Wearables/">Wearable Tech Group</a>. As part of this, we’d already done some experimentation with <a href="https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/Wearables/wiki/Bio-Materials">biomaterials and natural dyes</a>.</p>

<p>Just before the course started, we received this excellent kit in the post:</p>

<p><img src="https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/biobox/contents_of_kit.jpg?raw=true" alt="Biobox Kit" /></p>

<p>This was a good start, and I also had access to stuff we’d acquired previously for DoES Liverpool experiments, including a scale, heater stirrer, cornflour and ready ground cork, additional alginate, glycerol and agar, as well as some random containers to set materials in.</p>

<p>I soon realised, though, that I’d get more out of the course by investing a bit in ingredients and equipment, and ended up buying a £25 dehydrator (after Ross had done the same), a cheap saucepan, silicone sheets, different types of carrageenan, methyl cellulose, spirulina and activated charcoal - one good thing is that so far this is all food-safe!</p>

<p><img src="https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/biobox/dehydrator.jpg?raw=true" alt="Food Dehydrator" /></p>

<p>There were 4 Zoom meetings - one a week, where we discussed our experiments and Sarah and Zoe talked about the context of biomaterials use and gave us examples of practitioners working with everything from oyster shells to human hair; we also had a guest speaker, Sophie Hedderwick - she’s developing conductive biomaterials as well as working with natural dyes and inks, all really interesting.</p>

<p>At the last meeting everyone had 2 minutes to go through what they’d achieved - there were a wide range of interests from milk plastic to oak gall ink and one participant had done a lot of research on shells.</p>

<p>Here’s what I made: hopefully it will be useful in the future. From most of the pieces, you can see I didn’t do a good job of keeping the material flat - I think that’s the next thing to look into.</p>

<p><strong>Agar Bioplastic - <a href="https://materiom.org/recipe/41">Materiom Recipe Ag02</a></strong></p>

<p>Both these are pleasant materials. I accidentally added twice the specified amount of glycerol to the first sample, which has resulted in a clear and pliable material. The second sample is more rustly and less clear.</p>

<p><strong>Eggshell Composite - <a href="https://materiom.org/recipe/60">Materiom Recipe Eg01</a></strong></p>

<p>I was able to get a lot of eggshells from the cafe downstairs from DoES Liverpool, so made two batches, which came out more or less the same. I removed the membrane from inside the shells, dried them in the oven and then crushed them with a hammer (makeshift pestle and mortar). The material contains alginate and you pour vinegar over it to set it - this meant that it set much more quickly than the other materials. The output was hard and brittle and looked a bit like granite.</p>

<p><strong>Coffee Composite - <a href="https://materiom.org/recipe/171">Materiom Recipe Co02</a></strong></p>

<p>This came out well - it’s another alginate recipe and when we tried it at DoES Liverpool it went mouldy before it dried). I did dry the coffee grounds in the oven before starting this time, and used the dehydrator.</p>

<p>The result is slightly spongy, and dull looking - I don’t really like it aesthetically, but it seems quite strong and resistant.</p>

<p><strong>Cork Composite - <a href="https://materiom.org/recipe/40">Materiom Recipe Cor03</a></strong></p>

<p>We’d also tried this before at DoES Liverpool, and still had all the ingredients, including ground up corks. The output material is hard and strong, and would probably be good for moulding if it doesn’t shrink too much when it sets.</p>
