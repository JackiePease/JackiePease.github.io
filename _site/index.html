                <p>It’s been a while since I wrote any weeknotes, and although I’m just going to talk about one project - the comet workshop I did for Ryan and Andy at  <a href="https://www.conveniencegallery.org/">Wirral-based Convenience Gallery</a> - it does cover a bit more than a week.</p>

                <p>If you know me, you might be aware that I’m quite keen on addressable LEDs, so, while I already had a light up backpack for cycling (a prototype for <a href="https://peloton.coop">Peloton Liverpool</a>’s <a href="https://twitter.com/PelotonLiv/status/1499019125011668996?s=20&amp;t=nDrJC5sKxXCYXhn_cV9HPQ">Disco breastplates</a>), I couldn’t resist buying a <a href="https://mcqn.com/">MCQN Ltd</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/huffeec/status/1585560542080638979?s=20&amp;t=gtIk50p2UsO_uZefMUf0Gg">My Bike’s Got LED board</a> after watching the flurry of activity here at DoES Liverpool as Adrian and Chris got the first batch ready - they were launching with Peloton Liverpool Joyride cyclists taking part in <a href="https://katumba.co.uk/">Katumba Drumming</a>’s Halloween event.</p>

                <p>A quote from Nelson Mandela apparently. It’s been in my head recently as I spent several days working on an LED project I shouldn’t have agreed to do with too little time, too little experience with the tools I eventually had to use, and without ever getting to see the physical installation. It feels like I’ve learnt a lot though and I’m inspired to learn more. So here’s a few rough notes, so I don’t forget, and in case there’s anything useful to other people.</p>

                <p>Having done some maintenance on the pen plotter last month, I’ve mainly been experimenting with different pens and papers to see what effects they produce. I am aiming to use more refillable pens, but having been asked to produce a flower picture in the style of one of my earlier pen plots, it’s been more Sharpies, fineliners and gel pens recently.</p>

                <p>A month since my last “weeknotes”, so quite a lot to write about. Firstly Mike G replaced the original power cables we’d used for the Plastic Flowers with white ones. We covered these with netting tube known as “millinery crin” which we’d first seen when makers from DoES Liverpool were involved in this project for Batala Mersey drummers with Uma and Mandy from Brouhaha International.</p>

                <p>I’ve spent some time this fortnight trying to install the latest version of the <a href="https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/">WLED firmware</a> on the <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/mcqn_ltd/my-babys-got-led/">My Baby’s Got LED board</a> which controls my <a href="https://twitter.com/jackie_pease/status/1485331378178777092?s=20&amp;t=kq-CDlgLHMO2QyK8yB9Mnw">#plasticflowers</a> (each flower contains a ring of 8 WS2812 RGB pixels, so I’ll be able to use the new grid feature to set them up as an 8 x 45 grid and light them up individually). This has proved more challenging than I’d hoped, so I’m putting that to one side for a while (they do look ok as they are).</p>

                <p>I thought I’d slightly sabotaged my pen plotting project recently by getting qualms about the number of disposable pens I was getting through, but trying out various reusable alternatives instead is proving just as interesting. I’ve done more with the Rotring technical pens and Lamy fountain pens which I had already, and I’ve bought <a href="https://www.cultpens.com/i/q/PL01289/pilot-parallel-pen">Pilot Parallel Pens</a>.</p>
