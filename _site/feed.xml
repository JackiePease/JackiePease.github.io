        <title>Fortnight Notes - More on Plastic Flowers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Not quite weeknotes, but getting there…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of my last blog post, the Plastic Flowers had been carefully positioned in the base grid, a difficult job as they’re pretty fragile, so thanks again Sanna!:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/fortnightnotes_20220130/flower_stand_with_wires.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;flower_stand_with_wires.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, that still left a lot of wiring to be done. Mike G again volunteered to help with this, a task which apparently made him feel nostalgic for his time wiring up telephone exchanges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/fortnightnotes_20220130/mike_working_on_flower_electronics.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mike_working_on_flower_electronics.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also made a box to hold the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tindie.com/products/mcqn_ltd/my-babys-got-led/&quot;&gt;My Baby’s Got LED board&lt;/a&gt; and the PC power supply it runs off, based on one Arthur made for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mcqn.com/posts/weeks-821-822-questioning-a-mastodon-+-boxing-a-liver-bird/&quot;&gt;Electric Liver Bird&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/fortnightnotes_20220130/power_supply_box.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;power_supply_box.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The My Baby’s Got LED board lets you easily set up addressable LEDs to be controlled by &lt;a href=&quot;https://kno.wled.ge/&quot;&gt;WLED software&lt;/a&gt;. You can run WLED from a phone app over Wifi, so once it was set up, it didn’t take much to try out different effects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Afternoon spent wiring up the LEDs on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/plasticflowers?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#plasticflowers&lt;/a&gt; with Mike G at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/plastacs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@plastacs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/plasticplaygroup?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#plasticplaygroup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DoESLiverpool?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@doesliverpool&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They all seem to work - just the back to tidy up now and make a box for the power supply&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/wled?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#wled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ws2812?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#ws2812&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/mybabysgotledboard?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#mybabysgotledboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/weeknotes?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/xLWVUJ5Wli&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/xLWVUJ5Wli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jackie Pease (@jackie_pease) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jackie_pease/status/1485331378178777092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 23, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/fortnightnotes_20220130/flowers_in_various_colours.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;flowers_in_various_colours.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/fortnightnotes_20220130/flowers_in_white.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;flowers_in_white.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update the My Baby’s Got LED board to the latest version of the WLED software (I’ve had it for a while now, and a lots happened with WLED in the meantime). This will let me set up the flowers as a 8 x 45 grid (there are 8 LEDs in each flower), so that each flower can be a different colour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look into the sound reactive option in WLED as well, so that the flowers can react to music&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mike has suggested redoing the cables from the vase to the power supply in white so that they don’t show up against white table cloths at events (it seems like they might be the sort of think people would want to use at events, and you could even get them to match your bridesmaids’ dresses if you wanted…).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, the paper I ordered at the end of December eventually arrived (after a complaint), and Ed at DoES Liverpool lent me some lovely old technical pens, so I did some more experimenting with pen and paper options for the pen plotter. One of the pens was 2mm, so puts down a lot of ink, meaning that the paper stays quite damp. This seemed like a good test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greatart.co.uk/fabriano-bristol-paper.html&quot;&gt;Bristol board&lt;/a&gt; didn’t really stand up to the task, with quite large areas of damaged paper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/fortnightnotes_20220130/bristol_board.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bristol_board.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greatart.co.uk/fabriano-disegno-4-drawing-paper.html&quot;&gt;Fabriano Disegno 4 drawing paper&lt;/a&gt;, marketed as “extremely resistant to erasing, scratches and scrapes”, unsurprisingly did a lot better, with only small areas where the surface was slightly damaged:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/fortnightnotes_20220130/disegno_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;disegno_4.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d definitely recommend the Disegno 4, and I won’t give up on the Bristol board yet either; it seems to be what everyone in the pen plotter community uses so I’m sure I’ll be able to find out what works with it. The overlapping lines from the thicker pen, and even the ink-saturated and scratched surface are things I’ll look at using again too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was doing these experiments, Pablo, a new member of the DoES Liverpool community, came over to take a look at the pen plotter, and has some ideas on reducing the amount of wobble in the lines. So that’s what we’re going to be looking at next Sunday afternoon - and hopefully I’ll have some excellent new pen plots for my next WeekNotes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MonthNotes - Progress with the Plastic Flowers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I’d slightly sabotaged my pen plotting project recently by getting qualms about the number of disposable pens I was getting through, but trying out various reusable alternatives instead is proving just as interesting. I’ve done more with the Rotring technical pens and Lamy fountain pens which I had already, and I’ve bought &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cultpens.com/i/q/PL01289/pilot-parallel-pen&quot;&gt;Pilot Parallel Pens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem I’ve had is that finer pens (and water based ones) tend to dig up the paper. It looks as if you just can’t use more than 2 - 3 layers, but I’ve also ordered some tougher paper. This might be followed by some new ink, as only some are properly permanent - Rev Dan Catt mentions Noodler’s Bulletproof in this Instagram &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CYj10z4tQ1a/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some of the output. The first 2 are based on this Andy Wallace &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Andy_Makes/status/1470549299020943360?s=20&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; and this Keith Peters &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bit-101.com/blog/2017/10/flow-fields-part-i/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; and plotted in technical pen on card and calligraphy paper respectively. The card has been badly dug up. The calligraphy paper did better, although the blue ink stopped flowing half way through the second part for some reason, and the lines are a bit wobbly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/monthnotes_20220117/circles_plot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;circles_plot.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/monthnotes_20220117/bit101-flowfields.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bit101-flowfields.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Pilot pen arrived I didn’t have anything ready to plot, except a dxf grid for the plastic flowers. I wrote a bash script to convert it to gcode using vPype, Juicy GCode and the vpype-dxf extension:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;x &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$@&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do
   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; 1 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$f&lt;/span&gt;
   vpype dread &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$f&lt;/span&gt;.dxf scaleto &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; 250mm 250mm linesort write &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--page-size&lt;/span&gt; a3 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--landscape&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--center&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-out&lt;/span&gt;.svg
   vpype &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-out&lt;/span&gt;.svg ldelete 2 write &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-out2&lt;/span&gt;.svg
   juicy-gcode &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-out2&lt;/span&gt;.svg &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; flavor.txt &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$f&lt;/span&gt;.gcode
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juicy GCode needs a config file called flavor.txt, in the same folder. Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gcode
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   begin &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;G17;G21;G28;G90;G1 F400;M3 S05;G4 P0.3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
   end &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;M3 S05;G4 P0.3;G1 X.000 Y.000&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
   toolon &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;M3 S120;G4 P0.3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
   tooloff &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;M3 S05;G4 P0.3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pen worked really well on cartridge paper with a lovely smooth red (there’s some Sharpie on there too - I need to use them up!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/monthnotes_20220117/pilot_pen_on_cartridge_paper.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pilot_pen_on_cartridge_paper.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On calligraphy paper it was less smooth, but still a nice effect:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/monthnotes_20220117/pilot_pen_on_calligraphy_paper.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pilot_pen_on_calligraphy_paper.jpg&quot; /&gt;
~                                                                                                                      &lt;br /&gt;
I’ve had to take a break from pen plotting to make progress on the Plastic Flowers, which were cluttering up Room 29 at DoES Liverpool. In order to fill the light fitting / vase, I need 40ish flowers so laser cutting stems and hand cutting and heat pressing milk carton petals has taken a while. This week I’ve been lucky to have help from Sanna King and Mike Gorman, with assembly and soldering, so progress has been a lot quicker than it would have been otherwise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Lots of thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sanna_king?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@sanna_king&lt;/a&gt; (shown)and Mike G for helping me with my light up up plastic flowers this week. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;#39;Only&amp;#39; the wiring to go now. Hopefully it will be finished soon!&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/weeknotes?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/bU70S1Pr8M&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/bU70S1Pr8M&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jackie Pease (@jackie_pease) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jackie_pease/status/1482844377131241479?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 16, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Peloton disk lights I’ve been working on recently have been deployed successfully on 3 occasions now, including this Peloton Liverpool trip to Kirby:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Lovely &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PelotonLiv?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PelotonLiv&lt;/a&gt; Friday night &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/joyride?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#joyride&lt;/a&gt; to Kirby to visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cultureKnowsley?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cultureKnowsley&lt;/a&gt; light installation &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/aqualux?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#aqualux&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/DRcTuXQvaG&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/DRcTuXQvaG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jackie Pease (@jackie_pease) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jackie_pease/status/1482262962219978754?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 15, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there’s been a slight issue, obvious in this photo of Arthur at that ride. The light disks were attached to wooden spacers and those were attached to the backs with carpet tape… This issue didn’t show up in the earlier sets until they’d been in use for a couple of weeks. So I think I’m going to be gradually going through all the sets if and when they fail, using a scalpel to prise apart the VHB tape round the edges, and replacing the wood and carpet tape with acrylic and VHB …&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WeekNotes - Plotting with Refillable Pens</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve been spending a lot of my free time working on these &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amcewen/status/1467598114559299588?s=20&quot;&gt;lights&lt;/a&gt;, along with other members of the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://doesliverpool.com/&quot;&gt;DoES Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://peloton.coop/&quot;&gt;Peloton Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; communities; now they’re in action I’ve had a chance to get back to a bit of pen plotting (I am going to do a blog post on the lights once I get a few more photos together though, and there’s definitely more work to do in the future to take full advantage of the MCQN Ltd “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mcqn/my-bikes-got-led&quot;&gt;My Bikes Got LED&lt;/a&gt;” boards that control them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have any new code to plot at the moment, so thought I’d start off with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3&quot;&gt;DrawingBotV3&lt;/a&gt; again - I had some photos of this climbing plant that I’d taken back at the beginning of October but hadn’t got far with plotting at the time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/weeknotes_20211213/creeper_photo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;creeper_photo.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annoyingly, I had to spend the first day resolving hardware issues: trying to work out why I was getting errors from one of the limit switches (this somehow spontaneously resolved), and replacing the servo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first plot of the week, using Sharpies and an InkJoy fineliner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/weeknotes_20211213/sharpies.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sharpies.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a bit disappointed with the outcome - there’s a blue diagonal line across the picture, the thickness of the Sharpie lines against the white background make it difficult to see the image, and the registration is really bad. It felt like I’d forgotten everything I’d learned so far. I’ve now fixed the registration problem - I’d set up the bar that keeps the cables out of the way so one end was interfering with the pen holder moving back to the origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I wanted to experiment with refillable ink pens, as I’ve been shocked by the number of disposable pens I’ve been getting through. I’d used Rotring technical pens before with Rotring ink but seen on Instagram that some people were using fountain pen ink, which is cheaper and comes in more colours. I set the feedrate to 400 to try to avoid breaking the Rotring nibs (something that’s happened before) and this was the output after around 7 hours, using Diamine fountain pen ink in “Ancient Copper” on smooth white card:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/weeknotes_20211213/damage_to_paper.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;damage_to_paper.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite a pretty outcome, but this should have been the first colour out of 4, and the surface of the card was already badly shredded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I tried some Yupo - which is polyester sheet, not paper, and is strong with a very smooth surface. This is the result with Diamine fountain pen ink in “Claret”. Hardly any ink is absorbed by the Yupo, leading to a very pale colour. At least there’s less chance of the ink running out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/weeknotes_20211213/fountain_pen_ink_yupo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fountain_pen_ink_yupo.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a Rotring pen already filled with Rotring-alike ink so I tried that. It came out a lot darker than fountain pen ink, but still not as dark as it would have on paper. Because the picture didn’t look finished, I plotted the Magenta layer with the Diamine Claret ink:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again quite a pretty effect, and this time I managed two layers (the second one took  11 hours), but the Yupo surface was still quite rough and damaged in places:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/weeknotes_20211213/completed_yupo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;completed_yupo.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what I’ve learned is that I’m not going to get the sort of super-saturated effects from Rotring pens that I can get from the faster-drying solvent-based ink in Sharpies, although they might be ok for more geometric patterns where there isn’t much overlap betweeen lines. I think my next plot will be something like that, and I’ve also got a couple of fountain pens that I’m going to experiment with. I’ve been given some disposable pipettes so I can also try cutting off the end of a pen cartridge, putting some pauses in the gcode, and adding different coloured inks as the plot progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://plastictactics.com/&quot;&gt;Plastic Tactics&lt;/a&gt; Plastic Playgroup, and made some more milk carton petals for a bigger version of these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CTK_ezwsrnH/&quot;&gt;light up plastic flowers&lt;/a&gt;, another project I’d like to make some progress on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/weeknotes_20211213/petals.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;petals.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to laser cut some more stems from scrap ply, and then add lights…

        <title>DrawingBotV3 - Plotting without Coding</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the pen plotter at DoES Liverpool. It’s an A3 laser engraver base with a penholder and servo attached. I’ve been working on it`for a while now, and have mainly been learning about p5js and using it to produce &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JackiePease/p5js-sketches&quot;&gt;geometry-based patterns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/plotting_without_code/plotter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;plotter.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve been experimenting with ways people could use the plotter if they didn’t want to write code. One interesting piece of software I found is DrawingBotV3, which gives you a wide range of ways to produce interesting effects from bitmap files (inc. jpeg and png).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download the software here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SonarSonic/DrawingBotV3&quot;&gt;DrawingBotV3&lt;/a&gt; - it’s available for Linux, Windows and Mac, and the installation instructions are in the ReadMe section at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you just need to find a photo you want to make a picture from, or create your own bitmap file. Here I’ve used Inkscape with a quote (thanks to Ross Dalziel for the quote suggestion):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/plotting_without_code/ifyourenotangry.png&quot; alt=&quot;ifyourenotangry.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve used a bold font as detail is easily lost in this process, and added a background gradient so there’s something for the algorithm to pick up and so that it isn’t too uniform. I haven’t worried about the actual colours, as these will depend on the pens used when plotting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open DrawingBotV3, and from the File tab, choose “Export Settings”. For the plotter we have at DoES Liverpool you need to set the following so that the GCode (instructions sent to the machine) will lift and lower the pen and write in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/plotting_without_code/exportsettings_speedpenuppendown.png&quot; alt=&quot;exportsettings_speedpenuppendown.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I changed the feedrate to F2000 (the default is F8000, which is likely to damage some pens, but it’s definitely worth experimenting here)
The pen up and pen down setting will depend on the plotter you’re using. Currently I’m using M3 S40 for pen up and M3 S60 for pen down, but again this is subject to experimentation…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/plotting_without_code/exportsettings_direction.png&quot; alt=&quot;exportsettings_direction.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The x-direction has been changed to Negative to stop the plotter sending a mirror image - this will depend on the plotter, and whatever has been set up in firmware&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then import your picture and set the paper size and orientation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/plotting_without_code/ifyourenotangryimport.png&quot; alt=&quot;ifyourenotangryimport.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a whole load of options you can play with. Under “Path Finding Controls” select “Path Finding Module”. In this case I picked “Sketch Lines PFM”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also choose the pen settings – they’re not going to mean much unless you’ve got the pens that the program was written for, but might be good to choose a set where it’s easy to work out which pens you’re substituting (if you choose “Special” it gives you an option of CMYK separation, which I’m intending to explore next – could mean buying some more pens…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve chosen the options you want, click “Start Plotting”, you should see a representation of the plot on your screen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/plotting_without_code/ifyourenotangryplotted.png&quot; alt=&quot;ifyourenotangryplotted.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re happy with it, choose File → Export Per/Pen → Export GCode File&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(if you do it this way, you’ll get one file per colour. I like this as it means you don’t need to plot them all at once).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also options for saving to Inkscape, which is useful if you’ve got an Axidraw (Inkscape has its own extension for exporting to GCode).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://winder.github.io/ugs_website/download/&quot;&gt;Universal GCode Sender&lt;/a&gt; to send the GCode files to the plotter (Note: only the “Classic” version works on Linux). There are many other options though, especially if you’ve got a Windows machine…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Load the files in one at a time – DrawingBotV3 default is to start with the darkest – choosing appropriate pen colours and trying to start at the same point each time (I haven’t found the ideal way to do this as yet – some pen plotters have carousels or magnetic attachments that make it easy to load and unload pens).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This photo shows the output of just the first 2 GCode files (which are both black ink):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/plotting_without_code/ifyourenotangry_blackphoto.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ifyourenotangry_blackphoto.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and this is the final result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/plotting_without_code/ifyourenotangry_colourphoto.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ifyourenotangry_colourphoto.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I prefer the black and white version though!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried a few other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is “Voronoi Triangulation”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/plotting_without_code/voronoi_triangulation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;voronoi_triangulation.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does involve a lot of lifting and lowering of the pen, which is a bit noisy if you’re sharing a room, and is also likely to wear out the servo motor that does the lifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used “Sketch Squares PFM” for this house picture from a photo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/plotting_without_code/egerton_st_beige.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;egerton_st_beige.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and in blue….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/plotting_without_code/egerton_st_blue.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;egerton_st_blue.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detail is really interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/plotting_without_code/close_up_squares.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;close_up_squares.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think DrawingBotV3 is a good starting point for pen plotting - thanks to the developers. There’s lots to experiment with in terms of input files, options within the program, and pen and paper choices, then you can go on to think about coding if that’s what you want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Embroidery x Glue - A Weekend of Experimenting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A bit of experimenting, mainly last weekend, with machine embroidery and glue film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The glue film was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jarkman&quot;&gt;Richard Sewell&lt;/a&gt; who came along to the latest online &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/wiki/Wearable-Technology-Group&quot;&gt;DoES Liverpool Wearable Tech meetup&lt;/a&gt;, and as well as showing us his amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AirGiantsHQ&quot;&gt;inflatable robots&lt;/a&gt;, also showed us some fabric folding techniques, using a stiffer fabric ironed on with &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcb-supplies.co.uk/HotMeltWoodVeneerAdhesive.html&quot;&gt;glue film&lt;/a&gt; to provide structure. I’m quite interested in folded structures e.g. this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CI1Jl_HH6uM/?igshid=nx9a0mnhp1ky&quot;&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;, so ordered some of the glue film to try out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we’ve got a new embroidery machine, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/wiki/Embroidery-Machine-Fred&quot;&gt;Fred&lt;/a&gt; at DoESLiverpool, and it seemed worth looking at whether that had any potential as a way to stiffen fabric for folding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used my current favourite tool, &lt;a href=&quot;https://p5js.org/&quot;&gt;p5js&lt;/a&gt; to create an svg file (similar to the one I’d used for the tree). Admittedly this took me a lot longer than it would have taken with a CAD package, but it meant that I could easily change the number of rows and columns. I imported the file into &lt;a href=&quot;https://inkscape.org/&quot;&gt;Inkscape&lt;/a&gt; and used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://inkstitch.org/&quot;&gt;Ink/Stitch&lt;/a&gt; extension to create the .pes file used by the embroidery machine. I also exported it as as a dxf for use in the laser cutter - I love that you can the same base file with so many different CNC machines!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my first attempt, I started with 2 layers of scrap non-woven polypropylene and a layer of stabiliser. I was impressed by the way the embroidery looked, but I found it too difficult to keep the folds in position, and having lots of rows made it extra complicated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/1st_attempt_emb_column.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1st_attempt_emb_column.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/1st_attempt_back.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1st_attempt_back.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/1st_attempt_fold.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1st_attempt_fold.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave up and tried again with a softer fabric, fewer rows and more columns. This also looked great just flat. The interesting black and white effect isn’t intentional - the bobbin hadn’t been threaded properly, so the tension was wrong and the bobbin thread showed on the front (something to try to recreate by blending colours though!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/2nd_attempt_tension.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2nd_attempt_tension.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/2nd_attempt_front.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2nd_attempt_front.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/2nd_attempt_back.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2nd_attempt_back.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I removed the stabliser between the triangles, hoping this would give more flexibility. It was very difficult to get get the triangles to stay in position once folded, but after sticking the edges together to make a tube shape, it did eventually work (someone said this looked like a caterpillar, so that might be something to work on - I’d like to try adding servos…):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/2nd_attempt_folded.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2nd_attempt_folded.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the 3rd attempt I decided to use 2 layers of embroidery (actually 2 layers of fill stitch + 2 backing layers), made the triangles a bit bigger for easier folding and reduced the space between triangles. Disadvantages, not enough triangles round to make a column shape (this was the most that would fit in the hoop - there is a way to piece bigger embroideries together, so I’ll be looking into that), plus it uses lots of thread and is hard work for the machine. It did fold really easily and is quite a nice object to hold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/3rd_attempt_front.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3rd_attempt_front.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/3rd_attempt_folded.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3rd_attempt_folded.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more go, with smaller triangles and only 1 layer of embroidery - this took a lot of manual folding before the folds fell into place, but once it did, the structure seemed pretty stable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/4th_attempt_front.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4th_attempt_front.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/4th_attempt_folded.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4th_attempt_folded.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whie waiting for the embroidery machine (it does take a while), I tried out the glue sheets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cut out a piece of glue sheet, then ironed it onto the back of some thick satin curtain fabric brought in by Karen, who I’m working with on another project. As Karen was laser cutting some chain maille, we decided to use that as a test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/satin_glue.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;satin_glue.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/satin_laser_cutting.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;satin_laser_cutting.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After laser cutting, you need to remove the backing sheet, and then iron on to a substrate. We used baking paper to stop the glue sticking to the iron - the baking paper stuck to the fabric though, so not the best:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/satin_separating.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;satin_separating.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results were good, both with the left over teardrop shapes, and with the chain maille:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/satin_teardrops.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;satin_teardrops.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/satin_on_velvet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;satin_on_velvet.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then tried the folding pattern on 3mm ply. After laser cutting the ply we replaced the triangles with the glue side up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/ply_laser_cutting.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ply_laser_cutting.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/ply_glue.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ply_glue.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/ply_ironing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ply_ironing.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a fine soft fabric meant that the glue came through to the back. It also tended to spread a bit round the edges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/ply_back_fabric.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ply_back_fabric.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ply stuck well, but the output wasn’t really suitable for folding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/ply_lifting.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ply_lifting.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/ply_on_fabric.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ply_on_fabric.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got a lot of polypropylene at DoES Liverpool, so it seemed worth trying that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/pp_laser_cutting.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pp_laser_cutting.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did fold quite well, but as with embroidery, it would have been better with narrower channels in between the shapes. The polypropylene stuck well to begin with, but after a few days of being flexed it began to come away from the fabric. It might be better to use something more flexible if it’s designed to be moved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/pp_folded.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pp_folded.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also ironed the waste polypropylene on to some gauze; the glue spread badly because the fabric couldn’t absorb it, and the baking paper stuck. I washed this in an attempt to remove the soot from the laser cutter (it didn’t) and the glue seemed unaffected:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/pp_gauze.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pp_gauze.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, we ironed some foil sheets onto the waste ply - this would have probably worked better if we’d waited for the glue to set, but still a pretty nice distressed effect after a couple of sheets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/embroidery_x_glue/ply_foil.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ply_foil.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not quite sure where this is going, but maybe my next step will be to try some more flexible materials with the glue method and articulating some of the folding structures.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Biomaterials - Some Notes from the STEAMhouse Biobox course</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently took part in &lt;a href=&quot;https://steamhouse.org.uk/events/biobox-workshop/&quot;&gt;STEAMhouse’s Biobox Workshop&lt;/a&gt;, an excellent 4 week course combining “self-led materials research with live sessions [exploring] different areas related to materials development”, led by Sarah King of STEAMhouse and Zoe Powell of Materiom. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cheapjack.github.io/&quot;&gt;Ross Dalziel&lt;/a&gt; was also on the course - we’d both already done a bit of experimenting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/Wearables/wiki/Bio-Materials&quot;&gt;biomaterials and natural dyes&lt;/a&gt; at DoES Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before the course started, we received this really nice kit in the post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/biobox/contents_of_kit.jpg?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Biobox Kit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good start, and I also had access to the stuff we already had at DoES Liverpool, including a scale, heater stirrer, cornflour and ready ground cork, additional alginate, glycerol and agar, as well as some random containers to set materials in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I soon realised, though, that I’d get more out of the course by investing a bit in ingredients and equipment, and ended up buying a £25 dehydrator (after Ross had done the same), a cheap saucepan, silicone sheets, different types of carrageenan, methyl cellulose, spirulina and activated charcoal - one good thing is that so far this is all food-safe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/biobox/dehydrator.jpg?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Food Dehydrator&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 4 Zoom meetings - one a week, where we discussed our experiments and Sarah and Zoe talked about the context of biomaterials use and gave us examples of practitioners working with everything from oyster shells to human hair; we also had a great guest speaker, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sophiehedderwick.com&quot;&gt;Sophie Hedderwick&lt;/a&gt; - she’s developing conductive biomaterials as well as working with natural dyes and inks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the last meeting everyone had 2 minutes to go through what they’d achieved - there were a wide range of interests from milk plastic to oak gall ink and one participant had done a lot of research on shells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I made, take a look if you think you might be interested in DIY biomaterials. From most of the pieces, you can see I didn’t do a good job of keeping the material flat - that would be a goodd think to look into next. I’m sure I’ll be carrying on with this, especially the conductive materials, but I also really liked the carageenan leather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agar Bioplastic - &lt;a href=&quot;https://materiom.org/recipe/41&quot;&gt;Materiom Recipe Ag02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both these are pleasant materials. I accidentally added twice the specified amount of glycerol to the first sample, which has resulted in a clear and pliable material. The second sample is more rustly and less clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eggshell Composite - &lt;a href=&quot;https://materiom.org/recipe/60&quot;&gt;Materiom Recipe Eg01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to get a lot of eggshells from the cafe downstairs from DoES Liverpool, so made two batches, which came out more or less the same. I removed the membrane from inside the shells, dried them in the oven and then crushed them with a hammer (makeshift pestle and mortar). The material contains alginate and you pour vinegar over it to set it - this meant that it set much more quickly than the other materials. The output was hard and brittle and looked a bit like granite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/biobox/egg_shell.jpg?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Eggshell Composite&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee Composite - &lt;a href=&quot;https://materiom.org/recipe/171&quot;&gt;Materiom Recipe Co02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This came out well - it’s another alginate recipe and when we tried it before at DoES Liverpool it went mouldy before it dried. I did dry the coffee grounds in the oven before starting this time, and used the dehydrator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is slightly spongy, and dull looking - I don’t really like it aesthetically, but it seems quite strong and resistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/biobox/coffee_composite.jpg?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Coffee Composite&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cork Composite - &lt;a href=&quot;https://materiom.org/recipe/40&quot;&gt;Materiom Recipe Cor03&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d also tried this before at DoES Liverpool, and still had all the ingredients, including ground up corks. The output material is hard and strong, and would probably be good for moulding if it doesn’t shrink too much when it sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/biobox/cork.jpg?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Cork Composite&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirulina and Carageenan Iota ‘Leather’ - &lt;a href=&quot;https://materiom.org/recipe/191&quot;&gt;Materiom Recipe Ca02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d been inspired by Sophie Hedderwick’s talk about conductive materials at this stage, but the activated charcoal I needed still hadn’t arrived, so I decided to have a go at this recipe. I didn’t have any sage dye, so added 4ml of Spirulina powder, something else that the Materiom site suggests as a colourant. What I learned: by the time it dried out (seaweed recipes typically take several days), this produced a thin and fragile film - it’s quite smooth and has a lovely bottle green colour though, so I’ll try to use it for something. Next time I’ll pour it into a thicker mould though (and smaller so it fits in the dehydrator), and use less water to start off with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/biobox/spirulina_carageenan.jpg?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Carrageenan Iota and Spirulina&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conductive Materials! - Based on Materiom Recipes &lt;a href=&quot;https://materiom.org/recipe/191&quot;&gt;Ca02&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://materiom.org/recipe/212&quot;&gt;CoF 01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activated charcoal I’d ordered from eBay finally arrived. Sophie’s experiments used the Materiom recipe &lt;a href=&quot;https://materiom.org/recipe/208&quot;&gt;Ge04&lt;/a&gt; “Conductive Gelatin bioplastic” and the material she produced looked glossy and pliable material. I didn’t really want to use gelatin so decided to try a couple of plant-based recipes. The first was the Carageenan Iota recipe I used above. I added 16g of activated charcoal instead of the Spirulina and used a plastic box as a mould. Again it took a long time to dry and curled up a lot when I used the dehydrator. The second recipe was for Coconut Fibre and Agar Bioplastic - activated charcoal is made from coconut fibre, so it seemed reasonable to substitute it. I added 19g. This agar bioplastic dried a lot faster than the seaweed one, but I still used the dehydrator and it still curled up a bit. Despite containing glycerol both materials were hard and dull looking, but seem quite strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tested both with a multimeter and also used them as part of a circuit to light an LED. They’re both conductive (the carageenan biomaterial seemed more conductive than the agar one in this test) and I think could have some interesting uses in future projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Sarah and Zoe and everyone else involved in this course - definitely recommended if you get a chance!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>15 Minute Liverpool - Familiar Sights</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I wrote my first post I intended to get out and explore the area around DoES Liverpool on at least 2 lunchtimes per week. It’s been more than a month and I’ve only made 2 more trips, and only now got round to writing them up…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first trip was down to St George’s Plateau and then half way down Dale Street on 30 July, a beautiful warm and sunny day - I must have been walking fast to get that far, as it’s outside the 15 minute isochrone on Adrian’s map; it took me more than 20 minutes on the way back, uphill and in the heat:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/eNoG6cgYBic&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the Fabric District and into an area of large spaces and student apartments where the architects might have had a bit of fun applying different surface textures and patterns to buildings which have the same basic structure.
Then past grand classical buildings containing the city’s great cultural institutions. It certainly seems feasible to make a short visit to the art gallery or library on a lunch break from DoES Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the top half of Dale Street contains some excellent pubs, along with offices and sandwich shops. I returned along a slightly different route, past tourist cafes, Egyptian themed outcrops of the Birkenhead tunnel and a basrelief drum commemorating the victims of Hillsborough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a really lovely walk and shows the richness of the city easily accessible from Kempston Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second trip was on 17 August, to the city centre shops, my first visit since before lockdown. I started off via London Road, a mixture of older buildings, replacement apartment blocks and world food shops. There are some nice new outdoor spaces, with places to sit, and an unreconstructed market, before you get to the main street which is busy with buses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YJBjtYwBHpQ&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then went past the railway hotel and Lime Street station, fronted by a large new plaza, before crossing the road, down past the front of St John’s Shopping Centre and down through the busy pedestrianised area to Marks and Spencer. I hadn’t left a whole hour for the trip, so there wasn’t really time to do anything except buy a quick snack before returning in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it took me until Tuesday morning to put the photos together and load them onto YouTube. This time I used Adobe Rush, which was pretty quick - I didn’t crop or straighten the photos and I didn’t do any editing apart from adding titles. Ideally I’d like the time for each photo to be less, or to be able to flick through them as stills. I still haven’t worked out how to set up a website, so that’s the next thing, but at least I can link this page to my Instagram account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back at these trips, they both cover ground that feels very familiar and safe to me - I want to start looking at parts of the area I know less well and see what facilities they have to offer. I think I should start looking for particular features that might be worth recording and that tell us something about the local area. I think what I’ve been doing so far is very tangential to the 15 minute city idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adrian’s McEwen’s isochrone maps, which I’m using to judge how far I should be able to walk in 15 minutes, can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;trips.mcqn.com&quot;&gt;trips.mcqn.com&lt;/a&gt;, and I read an interesting article today about what it might mean for Camden here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/camden-town-unlimited/beyond-the-pandemic-the-prospect-of-a-15-minute-city-693b6a24e438&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/camden-town-unlimited/beyond-the-pandemic-the-prospect-of-a-15-minute-city-693b6a24e438&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>15 Minute Liverpool - First Look at the 15 Minute City</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen a lot about 15 minute cities recently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“this simple notion that all your basic everyday needs, from education to commerce to health care to culture and so on, are located within 15 minutes walk or bike of your front door”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how it might work - do people get to mix? Might you lose the special things you get in a city centre when you have to endlessly repeat the basics? I like having a pub near my house, but I’m definitely prepared to travel slightly further to exhibitions, libraries and well-equiped maker spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an interesting way of looking at we do need though, and how we can move away from cars to cycling and walking more - this seems like a good time to think about things when everything has already been shaken up by the COVID crisis - for me that means that the office I usually work from in Greater Manchester is closed, and I’m working from the coworking space at &lt;a href=&quot;doesliverpool.com&quot;&gt;DoES Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; (just over half an hour’s cycling from my home, so it doesn’t quite fit into the 15 minute city idea, but I love cycling into work- it gives me time to think and stuff to look at, and it’s good for you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like a good lunchtime project to start by exploring the area around DoES Liverpool - Adrian McEwen has been working on isochrone maps which show how far you can get in 15 minutes by cycling or walking (including for people with mobility issues) - you can find out more here: &lt;a href=&quot;trips.mcqn.com&quot;&gt;trips.mcqn.com&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s one of his maps showing how far you can get from DoES Liverpool in 15 minutes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jackiepease.github.io/assets/15-minute-liverpool/15-minutes-from-does-liverpool.jpg?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;15 minutes from DoES Liverpool&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by just walking to Rodney Street and back on Monday lunchtime - it took exactly half an hour, so the map is accurate, at least for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CnIKAuULK7w&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there’s lots more thought that can be put into this. For anyone else who’s interested, here’s a few links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adrian’s isochrone maps, as mentioned before: &lt;a href=&quot;trips.mcqn.com&quot;&gt;trips.mcqn.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 15 minute city repository in Github/Liverpool-UK: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Liverpool-UK/somebody-should/issues/35&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Liverpool-UK/somebody-should/issues/35&lt;/a&gt; - lots of opportunity for people in Liverpool to get involved&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And 2 articles on Paris: one from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2020/01/21/phasing-out-cars-key-to-paris-mayors-plans-for-15-minute-city/#5ccba7706952&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://annehidalgo2020.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dossier-de-presse-Le-Paris-du-quart-dheure.pdf&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; (in French) from the site of Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
